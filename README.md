# UCE_senescent_cells

This repository contains the code files used for the masterÂ´s thesis project: *Characterization of senescent cells using the Universal Cell Embeddings model (UCE) with single-cell RNA sequencing data*. The images, trained model and other generated files are stored in a google Drive folder due to their size, and can be accessed here: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BR6MiHFtKXx8H6wRLqGsK2TGhRMWu3Do?usp=drive_link).

All the files are organized as follow:

- **Analysis**: contains the code for each step of the workflow.
- **Sen_signatures**: text files with the upregulated and downregulated genes for each senescent signature.
- **Results**: outputs from the workflow.

The datasets used for the analysis can be found on the following links:
