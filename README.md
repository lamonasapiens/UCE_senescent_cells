# UCE_senescent_cells

This repository contains the code and main output files for the masterÂ´s thesis project: *Characterization of senescent cells using the Universal Cell Embeddings model (UCE) on scRNA-seq data*.

All the files are organized as follow:

- **Analysis**: contains the code for each step of the workflow.
- **Sen_signatures**: text files with the upregulated and downregulated genes for each senescent signature.

All the figures and other outputs from the workflow, including the SenCore signature and the trained model, can be found in this shared [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fkQlHaH-mAV5UosfoXwDHiU57mKP01xK?usp=sharing)

The datasets used for the analysis can be found on the following links:
