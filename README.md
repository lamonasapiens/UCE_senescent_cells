# UCE_senescent_cells

This repository contains all the files and code used for the masterÂ´s thesis project: *Characterization of senescent cells using the Universal Cell Embeddings model (UCE) with single-cell RNA sequencing data*.
The files are organized as follow:

-  Datasets: the original datasets with the raw data are stored in Google Drive due to their size. They can be accessed here: 
-  Preprocessing: this folder contains the following files:
-    preprocess_S1: code used to pre-process the data from the **S1** testing sample
-    S1_adata.h5ad: anndata object, output from preprocess_S1.
-    preprocess_ALL: code used to pre-process the data from the **ALL** concatenated selected datasets.
-    ALL_adata.h5ad: anndata object, output from preprocess_ALL.
