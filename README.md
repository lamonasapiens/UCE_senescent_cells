# UCE_senescent_cells

This repository contains the code and output files for the masterÂ´s thesis project: *Characterization of senescent cells using the Universal Cell Embeddings model (UCE) with single-cell RNA sequencing data*.

All the files are organized as follow:

- **Analysis**: contains the code for each step of the workflow.
- **Sen_signatures**: text files with the upregulated and downregulated genes for each senescent signature.
- **Results**: outputs from the workflow, including plots and the trained model.

The datasets used for the analysis can be found on the following links:
